## Table of Content


### Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive insights into students' academic performance, encompassing various influential factors. Key attributes include gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type (standard or free/reduced), and completion of a test preparation course. The primary objective is to delve into these factors and discern their impact on students' performance in exams. By exploring correlations and patterns within the data, I aim to unravel the influence of parental background, test preparation, and other variables on students' academic achievements. By doing this analysis, I hope to identify actionable insights that can potentially enhance educational outcomes and contribute to students' success.
